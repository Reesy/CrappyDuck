WARNING: To the poor individual or individuals that have the woe to read through this code, I must apologise. This code was mostly written while drunk and as such it became a massive spaghetti mess in a singleton pattern. It is absolutely horrdenous. This code brings shame on not only me, but on my bloodline.
